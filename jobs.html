<h5>About us</h5>
<p>
Ghosts is an independent team of artists making games based in Reykjavik, Iceland. We work remotely with team members in Norway, Belgium, The Netherlands and UK. It was founded by the 2 main developers behind the game NUTS (2021) to make a unique racing game. We are committed to creating a fair and safe workspace, collaborating with experienced artists, with support and flexibility for the workers.
</p>
<p>
Our next game is being developed in Unity for PC and consoles. It is a time trial racing game with a narrative single player experience and an online leaderboard component.
</p>
<p>
We are currently looking for several collaborators for contracts from now until roughly summer 2023. We are ideally looking for experienced candidates within Europe-compatible timezones. We are open and flexible to people working remotely and part-time or half-time.

<h3 class="c1">UI Artist / Designer</h3>
<p><i><b>contract | remote | estimated 2 months</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>modern graphic design aesthetic</li>
<li>mostly meta-game screens like menus, track select, race setup and race finish</li>
<li>turn wireframes into styled, final UI designs</li>
<li>create a consistent style between screens</li>
<li>we can work around your preferred tools</li>
</ul>

<p>
We need someone to help us figure out how to present the necessary information to the player in menus, map screens and dialogue screens. The game has a modern aesthetic/graphic designed art style, so an interest in modern aesthetics is a big plus. You will turn wireframes and UX requirements into UI screens that can be implemented. This includes doing layouting, creating necessary assets, stylesheets for recurring elements like buttons, lists, frames, etc...  and iterating based on feedback. You will be working closely with our art director, Joost Eggermont, to establish a cohesive style across UI screens, and with the developers to make sure all necessary information is present on each screen.
</p>
<p>
Most of the UI we need help with is 'meta-game' UI, i.e. it is not very interactive, it just needs to communicate game states and let players navigate between the screens and select game modes.
</p>

<h3 class="c2">Level / Track designer</h3>
<p><i><b>contract | remote | estimated 2 months</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>create race tracks in Unity, with custom editor tools</li>
<li>work within the constraints of our track and environment pieces</li>
<li>take a track from a concept to a dressed level</li>
</ul>
<p>
We need someone with level design experience to help us create interesting and good looking race tracks. Tracks are made in the Unity editor out of prefabs, with some custom tooling to speed up the process. They can be tested and iterated on easily. We are looking for someone who is interested in figuring out what types of tracks go well with our custom physics and racing "feel". 
</p>


<h3 class="c3">VFX Artist</h3>
<p><i><b>contract | remote | estimated 2 months</b></i></p>
<ul><li>create and improve racing and vehicle VFX in Unity</li></ul>
<p>
We need someone with experience in making stylized game VFX in Unity to help us bring the race-ship to life with sparks, smoke, explosions. You will be improving on and adding to our current effects, working closely with our art director Joost Eggermont. The game has a modern aesthetic that combines literal elements with more sci-fi/abstract ones, and the VFX need to fit this style.
