<h3 id="where-can-i-send-suggestions-and-ideas-">Where can I send suggestions and ideas?</h3>
<p>We love hearing your ideas and suggestions, our Discord is definitely the best place for you to float your brainstorms and share with the community at large, also the Steam Forums have a lovely community to share with. The developers on our team are regularly in the Discord and Steam Forums, they watch carefully and sometimes very quietly, the ideas that are the most original and gain the most traction with our community of fans and players. We are often inspired by such ideas and suggestions, often we find through strange circumstance that our team are having the same ideas that the community are suggesting. Sometimes on the surface ideas are terrific, sometimes we just can’t make them work, sometimes we do. You may find future features that very closely or almost exactly mirror an idea that has been suggested, this doesn’t mean we necessarily used a suggestion offered to us, very frequently we already have a planned list of features to move ahead with and we may priorities one that has been suggested independently by the community and gained community support. However we always reserve the right to craft and shape our Applications exclusively as we see fit. Our Applications are our babies and we love it very much, we love sharing information and hot takes with the community but we decide what features go or do not go into our Applications.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-make-adaptations-screenplays-comics-novels-of-your-games-">Can I make adaptations, screenplays, comics, novels of your games?</h3>

Any works by you, derived from our Applications and IPs, are for your own personal use and creative exploration only, you may share these works with others but not for commercial gain and you may not represent these works as official expansions or adaptations from Ghosts. We prefer if these creative works made by you are clearly tagged or labeled as ‘Fan made’.</p>
