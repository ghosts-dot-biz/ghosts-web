# Icelandic Game Developers announce new video game at GamesCom

#### Phantom Spark, a time-trial racing game developed by Icelandic game studio Ghosts, debuts its first trailer.
**Reykjavik, Iceland - 09/23/2023:** Ghosts is thrilled to unveil their all-new, momentum-based, time-trial racer, Phantom Spark, via a new trailer that debuted yesterday at the Future Game Show.

#### The road to Gamescom
The game has been in development since 2021 and is being developed by Torfi Asgeirsson and Joon Van Hove, founders of indie game studio Ghosts Ehf, out of their office in Hafnar.haus in Reykjavik. After successfully releasing their previous game NUTS in 2021, they secured a funding and publishing deal with the UK Games-publisher Coatsink. Two and a half years into development, the game has finally been announced to the public with its first trailer at Gamescom in Cologne

#### Phantom Spark - Pure time-trial racing game
There is no limit to your speed in Phantom Spark, encouraging you to push the boundaries and take risks to smash time trial records throughout its weaving, rollercoaster-like levels, Phantom Spark features both a full single-player campaign and the option to compete via local split-screen and online leaderboards and will launch onto  PC and Nintendo Switch next year. 

Momentum is everything in this gravity defying future-fantasy time-trial racer. Master the ancient tracks of this forgotten land as its ancestral guardians guide you along the way. Weave through spectacular ruins and glide through the air as you seek your ultimate goal of perfection via the game’s easy-to-learn and hard-to-master gameplay.

#### A different kind of racing game
Phantom Spark is not like other racing games. There are no circuits where you need to repeat many laps, instead the tracks are short and every single input matters. Your position on the track going into a turn, and the timing of the brakes, can give you a radically different outcome, which will make you want to replay these tracks over and over again until you perfect each corner.

#### What comes now?
The game will be in development for several more months as the developers finish up all the tracks, art and music. There will be several announcements leading up to the launch with new trailers and demos expected early next year. People can Wishlist the game on Steam and follow it on social media to get notified about future updates. It helps out the developers, as more wishlists increase the chance that the game is featured in the store at launch.

International collaboration and staying small
Ghosts Ehf. consists of just Torfi and Joon, but a total of 11 short-term contractors have contributed to Phantom Spark. Ghosts likes to work in a small team with reduced overhead and work with experienced freelance artists from all over the world. The only full-time team-member outside of the company is the art director, Joost Eggermont, based in Rotterdam. Other collaborators are working from Norway, Australia, Germany, the UK and the USA. This unconventional way of working enables them to collaborate with artists doing exciting work from all over the world.

#### Award winning indie game developers in Iceland
Before beginning to work on Phantom Spark, Joon and Torfi developed the game NUTS (2021), a surveillance mystery game where the player needs to spy on a group of squirrels in a remote forest. NUTS is a narrative adventure game where you place cameras near the habitat of a squirrel and record their movements. It has been called “Firewatch for David Attenborough fans” by TechRadar. 

Among other awards and nominations, it received the Nordic Game of the Year award at the Nordic Game conference in Malmo in 2022. The game was produced by Apple for the Apple Arcade subscription game platform, and was later released on Steam for PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is the second game developed in Icelandic to be released on a Nintendo platform. The game was in active development during the first year of the Covid pandemic.

#### About Ghosts

Founding members Joon and Torfi have assembled a team of experienced artists for the project, including Joost Eggermont as art director, to develop the highly stylized, pure time-trial racing game Phantom Spark.
